Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
A consulting company called Artemis Financial creates unique financial strategies for its clients. They engaged us to create their open-source web application and make it safe enough to handle the delicate financial and personal information contained inside.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I performed a good job using static testing to find the present vulnerabilities in the code base. Secure coding is crucial to preventing data theft and preserving the company's integrity and dependability image.


What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
By automatically finding vulnerabilities rather than having to manually examine each dependent for weaknesses, the dependency check tool was quite useful and helped save a lot of time.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Penetration testing should be important in the future to more accurately identify vulnerabilities.


How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
If new dependencies were introduced, the dependency check had to be re-run. Otherwise, functionality may be ensured by human code review and unit testing.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I found it quite beneficial to use the Internet to explore current procedures and algorithms.
